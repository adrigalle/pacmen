# PacMen

## Desription

This is a little exercise that has an "add PacMen" button that you can press as many times as youd like to add more pacmen to the screen. Once they are added you can press start and they will all just start moving and bouncing off that walls at varying velocities. 

## Roadmap

In the future I would love to make the pacmen change direction and face to the left when they go in the -x axis

## License

This is an open source project, most of the code was provided by MIT Coding Program
